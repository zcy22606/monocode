const USAGE: &str = r#"MonoCode local control — supervise this orchestration run from the lead agent.

Usage: {exe} control ACTION [--json JSON | --input FILE|-] [--request-id ID]

Actions, with the JSON object each one takes:
  list      {}
            The run, every task with its status and latest result, and the
            harness/model IDs you may assign.
  delegate  {"title":"Short title","harness":"<id from list>",
             "model":"<id from list>","prompt":"Self-contained instructions",
             "files":["src/feature"],"dependsOn":["<taskId>"]}
            Queue a worker and return its taskId. "model" is optional and
            defaults to the first model list allows for that harness.
            "files" is the write scope: project-relative paths, where a
            directory covers its descendants and ["."] reserves the whole
            checkout. "dependsOn" holds taskIds that must be reviewed first.
  get       {"taskId":"..."}
            One task, including its latest result.
  wait      {"timeoutSeconds":20}
            Block until a task changes state, or until the timeout (0-25).
            Returns at once when paused, stopped, or nothing is running or queued.
  respond   {"taskId":"...","requestId":7,"decision":"allow"|"deny"}
            Answer an approval an agent is blocked on. Agents never prompt the
            user; list, get and wait report the prompt as that task's
            "needsInput", and it stays stopped until you decide.
  answer    {"taskId":"...","requestId":9,"answers":{"<questionId>":["<optionId>"]}}
            Answer a question an agent asked, or pass "skip":true instead of
            "answers". The question and its options come from needsInput.
  steer     {"taskId":"...","text":"..."}
            Redirect an agent that is still running, without discarding the
            work it has already done. Use this the moment you see it going
            the wrong way; message only lands once it has stopped.
  message   {"taskId":"...","text":"..."}
            Send a stopped worker another turn within its existing scope; it
            keeps its session, checkout and history.
  retry     {"taskId":"...","text":"...","files":["src/feature"]}
            Retry a stopped worker with corrected project-relative write
            scopes. Use this only when the additional files are required.
  cancel    {"taskId":"..."}
            Cancel a task, whether it is running or still queued.
  review    {"taskId":"..."}
            Accept a completed task's result.
  finish    {}
            End the run, once every task is accepted or cancelled.

Usual loop: list -> delegate ... -> wait or get -> steer an agent that drifts,
unblock one with respond or answer -> inspect the changes yourself -> message
for corrections -> review each task -> finish.

When paused, list, get and wait still return the reason and recovery steps.
Do not keep polling or retry mutations. Explain the pause and ask the user to
click Resume in MonoCode. Resume continues interrupted workers in their
retained checkouts. A policy-blocked worker remains stopped until message,
retry or cancel explicitly resolves it.

Output is one JSON line: {"ok":true,"result":...} or {"ok":false,"error":"..."}.
The exit code is 0 only when "ok" is true.

Input must be a JSON object; unknown fields are rejected rather than ignored.
--json takes it inline, --input FILE reads a file, --input - reads stdin.

Every call carries a request ID, and the run applies each ID at most once. A
failed response reports the ID it used whenever the outcome is unknown — a
timeout, say. Retry that exact call with --request-id ID; retrying a delegate
under a fresh ID instead would queue a second worker.

Tasks run inside the MonoCode app, not in this process. Exiting this CLI, or a
failure here, never cancels a task that was already accepted.

MonoCode sets MONOCODE_CONTROL_ENDPOINT and MONOCODE_CONTROL_TOKEN for the lead
agent's process only. They are already in your environment; never print them.

const APP_USAGE: &str = r#"MonoCode app access — use in a thread enabled by /operator.

Usage: {exe} app ACTION [--json JSON | --input FILE|-] [--request-id ID]

A Mono works on several projects: add "project":"<path or name>" to the
sessions.*, worktrees.* and folders.* actions to choose which one. It may be
left out when the Mono has a single project.

Actions:
  models.list    {}  Available providers, models, settings and permission modes.
  sessions.list  {}  Project sessions with IDs, busy status and hasDraft.
  sessions.read  {"sessionId":"...","before":"<turnId>","limit":3,"maxChars":1200}
                  Read up to 3 recent user/assistant exchanges. Tools and
                  reasoning are omitted. Omit before for the newest page;
                  pass nextBefore from a result for older exchanges. maxChars
                  caps each message (200-6000, default 1200).
  sessions.send  {"sessionId":"...","prompt":"...","notifyOnComplete":true}
                  Submit a follow-up to an idle session in this project.
                  A busy session is rejected. Reuse --request-id on retries.
                  Optional notifyOnComplete:true asks for a completion report
                  in the calling Mono's chat. It waits until that Mono is idle.
  sessions.draft {"sessionId":"...","prompt":"..."}
                  Save an unsent draft in an idle project session. Existing
                  drafts are preserved; send or remove one in MonoCode first.
                  Reuse --request-id on retries.
  sessions.start {"prompt":"...","harness":"codex","model":"codex:...",
                  "effort":"high","reveal":false,
                  "workspaceMode":"current","worktreeCwd":"<path>","draft":false,
                  "placement":"right",
                  "besideSessionId":"<visible session ID>"}
                  Create a tab with the prompt, or set placement to right or
                  down to split a visible session pane. A split defaults to the
                  calling session; besideSessionId chooses another visible
                  session in this project, including one just created. Set
                  draft:true to save the prompt unsent; no agent turn runs.
                  Otherwise the turn is submitted.
                  Submitted sessions notify the calling Mono by default when
                  this turn completes, fails or is cancelled. The Mono reviews
                  it and reports back once idle. Set notifyOnComplete:false
                  when the user asks not to receive a report. Drafts do not
                  notify; notifyOnComplete:true cannot be combined with draft:true.
                  Sessions monitored during the same Mono turn form one group:
                  their results arrive together after every session stops.
                  The Mono reviews the whole group and gives one combined report.
                  Returns after creation/acceptance, not agent completion;
                  use its ID with folders.move immediately. Optional model,
                  effort, modelSettings, permission mode and workspace choice
                  use composer values. Set worktreeCwd to a path from
                  worktrees.list to choose a specific existing checkout, or
                  workspaceMode:"worktree" and optional worktreeBase to make
                  a new worktree with an automatic branch name. Omit
                  runtimeMode to inherit this
                  session's permission mode; set it to override. Run
                  models.list for allowed IDs. cwd is your project; no attachments.
  worktrees.list {}  Working copies in this project, with paths and branches.
  worktrees.create {"branch":"feature/name","base":"HEAD","existing":false}
                  Create a worktree on a named new branch from base (a branch
                  or ref). Set existing:true and omit base to use an existing
                  local branch. Pass the returned path as sessions.start's
                  worktreeCwd to start there.
  folders.list   {}  Folders in your current project.
  folders.move   {"sessionId":"...","folderId":"..."}
                  Or use "newFolderName":"Research" to create a folder.
  notes.list     {"limit":30,"offset":0}  Titles and short previews only.
  notes.read     {"id":"..."}  Full body of one note.
  notes.write    {"title":"Plan","body":"Markdown","tags":["work"]}
                  Create a note linked to this session and project. Omit title
                  to derive it from the body. Use {"id":"...","body":"..."}
                  to edit an existing note; title and tags are also optional.
                  Omitted fields stay unchanged. Reuse --request-id on retries.
  soul.read      {}  Mono's own conversation only. Current SOUL.md text and hash.
  soul.update    {"text":"<complete Markdown>","expectedHash":"<hash from soul.read>"}
                  Update your standing instructions only when the user asks.
                  Preserve the other instructions. If the file changed since
                  soul.read, read it again and reapply the requested changes.
                  Habit runs and other sessions cannot change a Mono's soul.
  memory.read    {"topic":"releases"}  Mono only. Without topic:
                  MEMORY.md, how much of it loads, and the topic names.
  memory.search  {"query":"release tags","since":"7d"}
                  Entries across MEMORY.md, topic notes and the archive that
                  share words with query, best first. since is a date or a
                  span (24h, 7d, 2w) and keeps dated entries from then on.
  memory.add     {"fact":"...","topic":"releases","until":"2026-11-01"}
                  Add one dated entry to MEMORY.md, or to a topic file when
                  topic is set. until is optional, for facts that expire.
                  Oldest entries move to the archive when MEMORY.md is full.
  memory.replace {"find":"text of the old entry","fact":"...","topic":"..."}
                  Strike the one entry containing find through and add fact.
  memory.remove  {"find":"text of the entry","topic":"..."}
                  Delete the one entry containing find, for a wrong entry.
  habits.list    {}  Mono only. Your habits: what each does, when it runs
                  next, and how its last run went.
  habits.add     {"name":"Morning CI check","instructions":"...",
                  "schedule":{"kind":"weekdays","time":"09:00"}}
                  Add only after the user agreed to it in this chat. kind is
                  hourly (with "minute"), daily, weekdays or weekly (with
                  "dayOfWeek", 0 = Sunday); time is local 24-hour HH:MM.
                  Each run is a hidden session that posts to this chat only
                  when it has something worth saying.
  habits.update  {"id":"...","name":"...","instructions":"...",
                  "schedule":{...},"enabled":false}  Change or pause one.
  habits.run     {"id":"..."}  Run one within a minute, to try it out.
  habits.remove  {"id":"..."}
  chat.card      Mono or habit only. Post a card to the Mono's chat:
                  {"type":"pr","repo":"owner/repo","number":123,"note":"..."}
                  {"type":"session","sessionId":"...","note":"..."}
                  {"type":"choices","options":["First choice","Second choice"]}
                  {"type":"habit","name":"...","instructions":"...",
                   "schedule":{"kind":"daily","time":"09:00"}}
                  choices accepts 1–4 options. A habit card is a suggestion;
                  the user must start it before it is scheduled.

The output is one JSON line: {"ok":true,"result":...} or {"ok":false,"error":"..."}.
Use --input - to pass JSON on stdin. Never print MonoCode credentials.
Keep the same --request-id when retrying a call after an uncertain result.
